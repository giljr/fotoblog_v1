# fotoblog_v1 Episodes List DjangoSeries ü§ìÔ∏è
Hi, this is all about [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) , a web framework for perfectionists with deadlines!

Django is a full-stack, open-source Python framework designed for efficient web development.

This is learning by doing: I am using openclassrooms, a leading E-learning Platform!:rocket:

Go to 
[django-web-app Site Course](https://openclassrooms.com/en/courses/6967196-create-a-web-application-with-django)
```	
A photography collective is looking for 
a way to share its work with the world. 
They want to be able to upload their photos 
online and also create blog posts about them. 

They have asked you, a Django developer, 
to build a web application that allows them to do just that. 
They need to have two tiers of users - subscribers and creators - 
and ensure that only the creators can create content. 
This content then needs to be shared in a social feed,
with subscribers choosing which creators they want to follow.
```

The material, to understand Django framework,
is envisaged as follows:

```
Epi #1 - Environment setup; Deploy proj/apps; git repo init.
	
Epi #2 - soon...
```

I versioned every advance I made during the course (Episode.01, Episode.02 and so on).

Go to tags and download each working code package.
